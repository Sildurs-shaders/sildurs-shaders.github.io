- Entities (players, mobs and such) can look a bit off at times. (Applied a temporary fix to prevent issues with transparency on entities)
- Lens flares is applied to everything bright (intended by chocapic), but it's rather annoying for gameplay. So disabled by default until recoded. Also requires bloom to be enabled.
- Bloom is not final, but the current one should be faster compared to v1.141.
- Motionblur affects your hand / handheld items, same for depth of field.
- Lite preset is no longer that cut down, the only thing that's missing are reflections.

Vibrant 1.141:
- Added an ingame option to change the amount of blur used by bloom.
- Reduced the amount of blur used by bloom a bit. Reducing blur makes the bloom effect abit weaker.
- Added an ingame option to adjust the lighting strength of emissive blocks, like torches.
- Lighting strength of emissive blocks is NO LONGER AFFECTED BY MOONLIGHT.
- Bloom strength is NO LONGER AFFECTED BY MOONLIGHT.
- Increased the max. allowed value for moonlight to 0.10.
- The whole lighting system has been rewritten, it's way better and less hardcoded now. (To allow tweaks)
- Alot smoother transitions between lighting states. No more jumpy lighting switches between day/night/inside
- Cleaned and optimized code(small performance boost), no more double defines @Sp614x
- Fixed and improved handheld items that cast light. Their light range is no longer nearly infinite.
- Mobs now flash red again when hurt.

Vibrant 1.14:
- New, much better bloom.
- Godrays are no longer visible while raining.
- Nights are now a bit brighter.
- Everything is now less dark while raining.
- Shadows are now a bit darker, to increase contrast and compensate for increased brightness caused by bloom.
- Overall some minor lighting changes, improvements and bugfixes.
- Emissive blocks now look better even if bloom is disabled.
- Motionblur works way better with the new bloom, I can only recommend it.

Vibrant 1.13:
- NEW, simple water caustics, also slightly changed transparency of water
- NEW, added more options that can be tweaked ingame is using Optifine 1.8.9 G9 or higher.
For example: Brightness during night time can be adjusted ingame now. Also things like shadow distance and resolution can be changed while playing.

Vibrant 1.12
- FIXED, Depth of field, thanks to Skate702 for indirectly reporting this issue.

Vibrant 1.11
- FIXED, Cel shading, thanks to Apechief for pointing that out!
- Updated whole shaderpack to support new optifine features better (Requires optifine 1.8.9 G9 or newer)

Vibrant 1.10
- NEW, simple HDR, your "eyes" now adjust to the lighting, for example: if you go out of a cave everything will be bright for a few seconds.
- NEW, Water has changed again, can be seen in the screenshot!
- FIXED, Bloom no longer gets cut of by the sky.
- FIXED, Leaves in the distance are no longer bright.
- IMPROVED, Bloom is less pixelated now, without a loss of performance!
- CHANGED, Turned bloom a bit down, as suggested a few times.
Important notes:
Lite and medium should experience a boost in performance, about 10-20fps more compared to v1.09!
High and extreme are now a bit more performance tanking in areas with water, before everyone starts to cry, it's only about 5fps worse compared to v1.09.

Vibrant 1.09:
- FIXED, Ice blocks in water.
- FIXED, Stars, they are visible at night again!
- FIXED, Maps, they are displayed correctly now.
- ADDED, Workarround to disable Minecraft's Pseudo lighting system. You can disable my workarround if you like the default MC lighting which darkens sides of blocks.
- ADDED, Cloud "distortion" for a more realistic movement.
- CHANGED, Sun glow at night no longer has the same redish color like daytime. It's now more blue-ish. (Moon glow)
- CHANGED, Godrays are now located in final.fsh and have been merged with lens flare code to reduce duplicated code.
- Code has been cleaned up A LOT, also lots of optimations being made. Performance should've increased for about 5-15frames!

Vibrant 1.08:
- FIXED almost all bloom issues, see bloom changes below
- NEW Bloom is now only active in dark areas, like caves or certain houses. (Based on the lightlevel arround your character)
Bloom is also enabled during raining and night time.

- Fixed composite error when turning off reflections while keeping godrays enabled.
 
Enhanced Default v1.06:
- Added godrays, disabled by default
- Added option menu Sky, includes options for godrays, godrays intensity and godrays quality.
*Fast godrays cause a low performance hit while fancy godrays cause a high performance hit.
- Added debug option draw bumpmap normals.

- Fixed a bug with the horizon being visible underwater.
- Fixed an issue with the sky being reflective at certain times.
- Minor code optimizations and the sky bug being fixed results in another performance boost!

Enhanced Default v1.052:
- Fixed tallgrass / doubleplants again, my previous fix broke in the latest optifine preview 6.
 
Enhanced default v1.051:
- Adjusted lighting to prevent blocks from being overblown by light, like sand.
- Added ingame option lighting strength to the shadows screen.
- Added bumpmapping support, WIP, causes some lighting issues.
- Fixed tallgrass / doubleplants from waving out of sync in 1.13+ (top and bottom half)

- Removed individual reflections options, they are now grouped together due to block id mapping using block.properties (see below for more on that one)
- Reduced shadow acne
 
Enhanced Default v1.01
- Improved performance, I get about 15-20fps more compared to v1.0. Make sure to update your optifine version, otherwise you might not gain that much of a boost.
