Credits to Chocapic13, raytraced shadows is based of his implementation.

Currently broken: Underwater fog

Enhanced Default v1.031:
- Added ingame option Fog

Enhanced Default v1.03:
- More code cleanup and optimization, should increase performance by 10-15%

Enhanced Default v1.02:
- Fixed an issue with normals, resulting in an overall performance increase of about 30%!
- Code optimizations and cleanup, further increasing the overall performance
- Added debugging options in misc, depthbuffer isn't really used but might be neat for some screenshots
- Added block.properties support, allowing you to easily add waving and reflections support for new blocks (modded blocks)
- Removed individual reflections options, they are now grouped together due to block id mapping using block.properties (see below for more on that one)
- Reduced shadow acne

Enhanced Default v1.01
- Improved performance, I get about 15-20fps more compared to v1.0. Make sure to update your optifine version, otherwise you might not gain that much of a boost.
- Fixed fog under/in lava. You might have to update your optifine version for this to work.
- Added ingame option Reflections Quality. (fast|fancy, default: fast)

Enhanced [redone] v1.0
- Initial release of rewritten enhanced default, everything has been improved.</code></pre>

    <pre><code class="changelog">Sildur's fabulous shaders v1.0:
- Inital release, features: Antialiasing (FXAA), Bloom, depth of field, cel shading, tonemapping (colors).
- Also supports Bumpy and Blobs from the old secret shader settings. 
Everything can be tweaked in "Sildur's fabulous shaders v1.0\assets\minecraft\shaders\program" by editing sildurs_shaders.fsh with an editor like notepad++
//#define Bloom means Bloom is disabled, removing the two slashes -> #Bloom enables it.
Resourcepacks can be reloaded ingame by pressing F3+T</code></pre>
